Hi there! 👋🏾 Welcome to my README.

I'm ```Clara Seijo```, and here's a little about my approach and style as a front-end developer.

## In a Nutshell

I'm a **pragmatic front-end developer**, blending a hands-on, functional approach with minimalistic design. I ensure accessibility in my works, aiming for clarity and conciseness. Above all, I make sensible decisions that prioritize user experience, creating both aesthetically pleasing and functional outputs.

## My Approach & Style

**1. Pragmatic** → ```Prioritizing working solutions over passing trends with a direct and hands-on approach.```          
**2. Functional** → ```Focusing on functionality where every element serves a clear and meaningful purpose.```             
**3. Minimalistic** → ```Championing simplicity by removing the unnecessary in both design and code.```                      
**4. Accessible** → ```Ensuring developments are inclusive and usable by everyone, regardless of abilities.```             
**5. Clear** → ```Work is understandable and straightforward in both design and code.```                              
**6. Concise** → ```Getting to the point with solutions that are short & sweet, focusing on the essentials.```          
**7. Sensible** → ```Making reasoned decisions, considering users' needs and emotions in design and development.```
